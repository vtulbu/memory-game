## Overview

This is a simple page developed with NextJS and Chakra UI.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the Memory game either solo or multiplayer (up to 4 players)
- Set the theme to use numbers or icons within the tiles
- Choose to play on either a 6x6 or 4x4 grid

### What I learned

I Learned to use Context React hook and how to pass props deep inside tree. Also, I learned to manage state and to change it dependends on the game.
